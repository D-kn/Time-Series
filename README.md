# Time Series Classification

Time series prediction and classification is one of major problems in industry such as Health service , Financial and so on. <br>
Deep Learning is known capable to do great job when extracting complex patterns from the data, but this power comes <br> with some problems such as interpretability of the decision taken by the network to do such prediction based on time series characteristics. <br>
In this work we use CAM (Class Activation Map) to interpret the decision from the network. <br> 
We built two networks : FCN and ResNet on the benchmark dataset UCR. <br>
